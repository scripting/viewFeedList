Switched over to reading the OPML file via a proxy server. We're running on HTTPS now and there's no other way to read an HTTP file

Made a mistake when announcing this utility, and the link got out there, so i redirect from the bad link to the good one in startup.

We now to use a dialog input to enter the url in, problem if the url has a ? in it if you use a url param.

Set up the domain for this, viewfeedlist.opml.org.
